<p>In my recent research project, I explored the fascinating intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
    healthcare. Specifically, I worked on using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with open Small Language Models
    (SLMs) to create effective medical chatbots.</p>

<h3>Why RAG for Medical Applications?</h3>

<p>Medical applications require accuracy, reliability, and up-to-date information. Traditional LLMs, while powerful, can
    sometimes hallucinate or provide outdated information. RAG solves this by combining the generative capabilities of
    LLMs with a knowledge base that can be updated with the latest medical research and guidelines.</p>

<p>The healthcare domain is particularly sensitive because incorrect information can have serious consequences. RAG
    allows us to ground the model's responses in verified medical sources, significantly reducing the risk of
    misinformation.</p>

<h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>

<p>One of the main challenges was ensuring that the chatbot provides accurate medical information while maintaining
    conversational quality. We addressed this by carefully curating the knowledge base and implementing strict retrieval
    mechanisms.</p>

<p>Another challenge was working with resource-constrained devices. This is where Small Language Models became crucial -
    they allow for offline functionality while still providing meaningful interactions. This is particularly important
    for healthcare applications in areas with limited internet connectivity.</p>

<h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

<p>Our implementation involved several key components:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Careful selection and preprocessing of medical documents</li>
    <li>Efficient vector embeddings for semantic search</li>
    <li>Fine-tuning of small language models for medical context</li>
    <li>Robust evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results and Future Work</h3>

<p>Our research showed promising results in using RAG-enhanced SLMs for hypertension management. The system was able to
    provide accurate, contextually relevant responses while running efficiently on mobile devices.</p>

<p>This work opens up exciting possibilities for making healthcare more accessible, especially in areas with limited
    internet connectivity. Future directions include expanding to other medical domains and improving the model's
    ability to handle complex multi-turn conversations.</p>
