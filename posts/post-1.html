<p>Living in 5 different countries has been one of the most transformative experiences of my life.
    Each country brought new challenges and opportunities, and I learned to navigate different languages, customs, and
    ways of thinking.</p>

<p>I was born in Afghanistan and moved to India for my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at
    the NIT Kurukshetra.
    I moved there right after my high school, and I spent 4 years there. this was my first time living away from my
    family and I had to learn to fend for myself.
    As someone who studies all my life in Farsi, I had to do my studies in English, although I was not fluent in it and
    indian system of education is very different from the one I was used to.
    This experience was a great challenge for me, but it also gave me a lot of opportunities to grow and learn.
    I was also very much touched bty the indian culture and the way of life, popele were very kind and helpful, and I
    made many friends there. I have travelled to many places in India, including Kashmir, Shimla,Goa, and many other
    places.

<h3>Adapting to New Cultures</h3>

<p>One of the most important lessons I've learned is adapting to new cultures and environments.
    When you're adapting to new environments, you develop a resilience that serves you well in both personal and
    professional settings.

<h3>Learning and Growth</h3>

<p>I traveled mostly pursuing my studies, this lead to being exposed ot different education systems across different
    countries. This also gave me the opportunity to experience different cultures and ways of life.

    I was in Oslo, Norway for my master thesis, and I was so impressed by the education system there.
    The best education system I've experiances, is the Norwegian education system.
    Where students are given more freedom to learn and explore their interests, and the teachers are more like mentors
    and guides.
    I was shocked to know that there are no exams at the school level.
    Students are encouraged to express their ideas, and they are happend to be more creative and innovative rather than
    just memorizing the material for the exams.
