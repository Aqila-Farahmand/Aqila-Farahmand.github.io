<p>Living in 5 different countries has been one of the most transformative experiences of my life.
    Each country brought new challenges and opportunities, and I learned to navigate different languages, customs, and
    ways of thinking.</p>

<h3>My Journey to India</h3>
<p>I was born in Afghanistan and moved to India for my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at
    the NIT Kurukshetra.
    I moved there right after my high school, and I spent 4 years there. this was my first time living away from my
    family and I had to learn to fend for myself.
    As someone who studies all my life in Farsi, I had to do my studies in English, although I was not fluent in it and
    indian system of education is very different from the one I was used to.
    This experience was a great challenge for me, but it also gave me a lot of opportunities to grow and learn.
    I was also very much touched bty the indian culture, popele were very kind and helpful, and I
    made many friends there. I have travelled to many places in India, including Kashmir, Shimla,Goa, and many other
    places.

<h3>Adapting to New environments</h3>

<p>One of the most important skills I've learned is adapting to new environments.
    When you're adapting to new environments, you develop a resilience that serves you well in both personal and
    professional settings.
    For example, in the summer the temprature reaches up to 48 degress and humidity is very high, and spicy food is the
    norm.
    I was brought up in a cold and mountain region of Afghanistan and I was not used to such high temperatures and
    humidity.
    I would not say that I adopted to all these changes instantly, it was very challenging for me to
    adjust to all these changes.
    Humans are very adaptable creatures, and we can adapt to new environments with time.

<h3>Learning and Growth</h3>

<p>I traveled mostly pursuing my studies, this lead to being exposed to different education systems across different
    countries, and also gave me the opportunity to experience different cultures and ways of life.
