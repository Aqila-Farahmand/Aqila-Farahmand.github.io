<p>Living in 5 different countries has been one of the most transformative experiences of my life.
    Each country brought new challenges and opportunities, and I learned to navigate different languages, customs, and
    ways of thinking.</p>

<p>I was born in Afghanistan and moved to India for my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at
    the NIT Kurukshetra.
    I moved there right after my high school, and I spent 4 years there. this was my first time living away from my
    family and I had to learn to fend for myself.
    As someone who studies all my life in Farsi, I had to do my studies in English, although I was not fluent in it and
    indian system of education is very different from the one I was used to.
    This experience was a great challenge for me, but it also gave me a lot of opportunities to grow and learn.
    I was also very much touched bty the indian culture and the way of life, popele were very kind and helpful, and I
    made many friends there. I have travelled to many places in India, including Kashmir, Shimla,Goa, and many other
    places.

<h3>Adapting to New Cultures</h3>

<p>One of the most important lessons I've learned is the value of being flexible. When you're constantly adapting to new
    environments, you develop a resilience that serves you well in both personal and professional settings.
    Learning to be self-sufficient and independent has been a great lesson, and I am grateful for the opportunities I
    have had to grow and learn.

<p>Each country presented unique challenges - from learning new languages to understanding local customs and social
    norms. These experiences taught me to be more observant, and understanding of different cultures and ways of life.

<h3>Professional Growth</h3>

<p>This international experience has also shaped my approach to science and technology. Working with people from
    diverse backgrounds has taught me that there are many ways to approach a problem, and the best solutions often come
    from combining different perspectives.</p>

<p>The ability to communicate across cultures has been invaluable in my life. It has helped me
    understand different people and appreciate various cultures and ways of life.</p>

<h3>Personal Reflections</h3>

<p>Looking back, I'm grateful for every experience, even the challenging ones. They've made me who I am today - someone
    who can adapt quickly, appreciate diversity, and find common ground with people from all walks of life.</p>
