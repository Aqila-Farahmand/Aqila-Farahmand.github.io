What stays with you when you leave a country behind? 
Is it the syntax of a new language, the taste of the local air, or
the way the people define 'happiness'? 

Having called Afghanistan, India, Italy, Norway, and recently Luxembourg home, I have 
learned that culture isn't something you observe, it is something you absorb. 
My journey has been a masterclass in adaptation, and it all began with a life changing chapter in India.

<h3>My Journey to India</h3>

<p>
    Fresh out of high school, I swapped the familiar comforts of home for the rigorous halls of NIT Kurukshetra. It was a
    leap of faith: my first time living away from my family and my first time navigating a world entirely in English, having
    studied in Farsi all my life. The Indian education system was very different from the one I was used to, but the real classroom was outside the
    lecture hall.
    
    I found my rhythm on the volleyball court. Playing for the university team wasn't just about winning the 2018
    ITUSA (Inter-Technology University Sports Association) championship; it was where I learned Hindi, the key that truly unlocked India for me. From the sun-soaked beaches of Goa
    to the mountain air of Shimla, I traveled far and wide, but nothing compared to Kashmir. Thanks to a university friends
    incredible family, I experienced the legendary hospitality of Srinagar. I can still see the reflection of the mountains
    on Dal Lake from Char Chinar Island and remember the horse riding through the valley of Pahalgam as we trekked through the 'Mini
    Switzerland' of India.

<h3>Adapting to New environments</h3>
<p>
Adapting to a new environment is a lesson in resilience that offers rewards in every aspect of life. 
Coming from the cool, crisp mountain air of Afghanistan, the Indian summer was a physical shock. 
I found myself in 48°C heat with humidity so thick you could almost touch it, paired with a cuisine where 'spicy' was the baseline, not the exception. 
I didn't adjust overnight; there were days when the transition felt impossible. 
But humans are remarkably adaptable. With time, what was once overwhelming became my new normal, proving that we don't just survive change, we evolve through it.

<h3>Learning and Growth</h3>

<p>I traveled mostly pursuing my studies, this lead to being exposed to different education systems across different
    countries, and also gave me the opportunity to experience different cultures and ways of life.
